Show that the square root of 2 is irrational.

Contradiction:
Irrational numbers are any numbers that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers, so assume that √2 is rational.

- √2 = p/q

Where p and q have no common factors (otherwise the common factors would be canceled from the numerator and denominator). Now by squaring both sides:

- 2 = (p/q)^2
- 2 = p^2/q^2
- 2q^2 = p^2

I found that the most useful video was the one for recurrence. It does an excellent job of not only showing what recursion is, but also how to calculate numbers in a recursive sequence and how to develop a formula for calculating any number in a recursive sequence. The video also goes above and beyond the parameters of its initial purpose by showing the proof for the calculus-based formula used in creating the recursive sequence formulas (i.e. (n(n-1))/2). The video also goes completely beyond the scope of its original purpose to teach an important life lesson about the importance of not sharing useful class-related information with fellow students in a class utilizing a bell curve to calculate final grades as you run the risk of hurting your scores by helping others lift up theirs.
